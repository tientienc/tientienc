					<h1>Hello there! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
					<p>I'm Tien-Tien (pronounced tea-an twice)! Iâ€™ve always been a tinkerer. Making to create and creating to make. I began in video production and mass communication because I valued the ability to create worlds and tell stories for others to experience. The initial interaction that brought me to design was when I began dabbling with Adobe Illustrator due to school projects and pure curiosity.  It gave way to investigating other forms of design and fell upon user experience design. Thatâ€™s when I realized that user experience design was how I wanted to tell stories.</p>
					<p>My biggest influences have been YouTube and food (yes food). YouTube was what inspired me to go into video production and pursue the impact of connecting with people through stories. As for food, (I have a whole spiel on it), the main point is, Iâ€™ve never seen food as only a source of fuel. Growing up it has always been a platform to learn about others, and a way to show hospitality. Itâ€™s the energy and experience that food enables us to bring people together.</p>
					<p>As I continue to grow as a designer, my understanding of design has evolved to associate it as a form of storytelling and hospitality. I aim to craft engaging media that communicate the intended voices for brands. I hope to create platforms that support human connection. I strive to design experiences that understand humans so that they can engage with joyful interactions.</p>
